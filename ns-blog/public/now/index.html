moving to new york

building a personal newsletter service for my friends: ring
It&rsquo;s been about a year since I started working on a personal newsletter service for my friends and about 6 months since I published it for us to use. With about 45 monthly users, that&rsquo;s 3 unique groups (1 of which I&rsquo;m not even part of!), it&rsquo;s been a really fun journey evolving the platform." />

<p>Of course the whole service is very overengineered: I&rsquo;m using individual docker containers for all the services (nginx, celery, redis, fastapi), multiple AWS services (postgres RDS, SES, S3 + cloudfront), all hosted on a single EC2 machine with 1 GB of memory that costs <strong>absolutely nothing</strong> per month!</p>
