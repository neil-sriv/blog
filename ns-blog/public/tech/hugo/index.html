  <h2 id="setting-up-my-personal-blog-with-hugo">setting up my personal blog with <code>hugo</code></h2>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been reading a ton of blog posts on <code>bluesky</code> from other engineers and developers or maybe it&rsquo;s because I have a oversized belief that my thoughts are actually interesting (like most software engineers), but I&rsquo;m finally starting a blog.</p>
<p>after doing a bit of research, I settled on using <code>hugo</code> for my auto-generated website and hosting through <code>github pages</code>. I considered some self-hosting alternatives like <code>nginx</code> and <code>caddy</code>, but after docs on the <code>hugo</code> site made it really easy to auto-deploy on <code>github pages</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>turns out, auto-deployment is a bitch to solve by yourself on a self-hosted machine. I&rsquo;m not trying to deal with jenkins or buildkite.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="lets-get-into-it">let&rsquo;s get into it</h3>
<p>now the <code>hugo</code> docs may have helped with the deployment, but their ease-of-use ended there.</p>
<h3 id="what-the-heck-is-">what the heck is {{}}</h3>

<h3 id="pagination---bless-jmooringhttpsgithubcomjmooring">pagination - bless <a href="https://github.com/jmooring">jmooring</a></h3>
<h3 id="anything-else">anything else?</h3>
<p>the only annoying part of the workflow left at this point (besides any site framework changes), is that in order to actually publish a new post, I have to move the content from my editor, <code>obsidian</code>, to my <code>hugo</code> git repository and push my changes. it may be possible to use <code>rsync</code> or symlinks to link my <code>obsidian</code> content directory directly to a directory in my blog repo, but I&rsquo;m thinking about exploring ways to access my <code>obsidian</code> synced vaults via an API.</p>
