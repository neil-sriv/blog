# blog?

trying out a blog for writing quick posts. most likely about [tech]({{< ref "/tags/tech" >}} "tech") but might end up writing about other stuff.

don't expect the content here to stay stable, I tend to randomly push updates and edits whenever I feel like it :man_shrugging:

hosting this blog on `github pages` for now, using `Hugo` for site generation.
