## moving to new york

I finally moved to NYC in January 2025! After 2.5 years in San Francisco, I've moved over to the East Coast. Living in Manhattan for now and still working at [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/).

## building a personal newsletter service for my friends: ring

It's been about a year since I started working on a personal newsletter service for my friends and about 6 months since I published it for us to use. With about 45 monthly users, that's 3 unique groups (1 of which I'm not even part of!), it's been a really fun journey evolving the platform.

Of course the whole service is very overengineered: I'm using individual docker containers for all the services (nginx, celery, redis, fastapi), multiple AWS services (postgres RDS, SES, S3 + cloudfront), all hosted on a single EC2 machine with 1 GB of memory that costs **absolutely nothing** per month!
